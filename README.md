# ðŸ›’Joyeux Shoppers Data Analysis 

This README file gives a detailed description of the project. Three years' worth of sales data from Joyeux Shoppers, an online retailer, was used for this research. Products, users, orders, distribution_centers, orders_items, inventory_items, and events are all included in the data. Sales statistics, demographics, gender, age distribution, top-selling products, categories, and brand information were all obtained from these data. Analysis was also done on loyalty programmes and top-performing channels. Using PowerBI, a visual representation of this analysis was created. 

## Data Preparation & Loading

A MySQL 8.0 database named capstone_db was created using AWS RDS to store the provided sales data and load the data into respective tables. The free tier elegible instance type was used.

## Table Creation 

Using SQL queries, seven (7) tables were created from the CSV files provided. Below is the list;
- Products
- Orders
- Orders_items
- Users
- Inventory_items
- Events
- distribution_centers

## Design an ERD

A simple Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between these tables was created using draw.io

## Python Scripts 

Using Jupyter Notebook, Python scripts were written to load the CSV files into their respective tables in the MySQL database.

## Sales Analysis
